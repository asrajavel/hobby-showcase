# Coding ðŸ’»

My passion for creating, problem-solving, and building things that make a difference. From web applications to automation scripts, coding allows me to bring ideas to life.

## Technologies I Work With

### Frontend Development
- **React** - Building interactive user interfaces
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript development
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

### Backend Development
- **Node.js** - Server-side JavaScript
- **Python** - Data processing and automation
- **Express.js** - Web application framework
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database

### DevOps & Tools
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Git** - Version control
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD automation
- **AWS** - Cloud services

## Current Projects

- **Personal Website** - Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Recipe Manager** - React, Node.js, PostgreSQL
- **Photography Portfolio** - React, Firebase, Cloudinary
- **Automation Scripts** - Python, Shell scripting

## Learning Goals

### Short-term (3-6 months)
- Master advanced TypeScript patterns
- Learn GraphQL for API development
- Improve testing practices with Jest and Cypress

### Medium-term (6-12 months)
- Dive deeper into cloud architecture
- Learn Rust for systems programming
- Explore machine learning with Python

### Long-term (1+ years)
- Contribute to open-source projects
- Build a SaaS product from idea to launch
- Learn mobile development

## Coding Philosophy

- **Clean Code** - Write code that's easy to read and understand
- **Testing** - Write tests for critical functionality
- **Documentation** - Document complex algorithms and business logic
- **Version Control** - Use Git for all projects with meaningful commits

## Development Workflow

- Use Git for version control with meaningful commit messages
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Run automated tests before committing
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow consistent coding standards

## Open Source Contributions

I believe in giving back to the programming community:
- Documentation improvements
- Bug fixes for tools I use regularly
- Small feature additions to helpful libraries
- Code reviews and feedback

## Programming Challenges

- **100 Days of Code** - Daily coding practice
- **Advent of Code** - Algorithm challenges
- **LeetCode** - Data structure and algorithm practice
- **Build in Public** - Sharing project progress

## Future Aspirations

- Master system design and architecture
- Learn advanced algorithms and data structures
- Explore emerging technologies (AI/ML, Web3)
- Contribute to meaningful open-source projects
- Build and launch my own SaaS product
